/**
 * Sorts and potentially merges a number of key-value pairs of type (K, V) to produce key-combiner
 * pairs of type (K, C). Uses a Partitioner to first group the keys into partitions, and then
 * optionally sorts keys within each partition using a custom Comparator. Can output a single
 * partitioned file with a different byte range for each partition, suitable for shuffle fetches.
 *
 * If combining is disabled, the type C must equal V -- we'll cast the objects at the end.
 *
 * Note: Although ExternalSorter is a fairly generic sorter, some of its configuration is tied
 * to its use in sort-based shuffle (for example, its block compression is controlled by
 * `spark.shuffle.compress`).  We may need to revisit this if ExternalSorter is used in other
 * non-shuffle contexts where we might want to use different configuration settings.
 *
 * @param aggregator optional Aggregator with combine functions to use for merging data
 * @param partitioner optional Partitioner; if given, sort by partition ID and then key
 * @param ordering optional Ordering to sort keys within each partition; should be a total ordering
 * @param serializer serializer to use when spilling to disk
 *
 * Note that if an Ordering is given, we'll always sort using it, so only provide it if you really
 * want the output keys to be sorted. In a map task without map-side combine for example, you
 * probably want to pass None as the ordering to avoid extra sorting. On the other hand, if you do
 * want to do combining, having an Ordering is more efficient than not having it.
 *
 * Users interact with this class in the following way:
 *
 * 1. Instantiate an ExternalSorter.
 *
 * 2. Call insertAll() with a set of records.
 *
 * 3. Request an iterator() back to traverse sorted/aggregated records.
 *     - or -
 *    Invoke writePartitionedFile() to create a file containing sorted/aggregated outputs
 *    that can be used in Spark's sort shuffle.
 *
 * At a high level, this class works internally as follows:
 *
 *  - We repeatedly fill up buffers of in-memory data, using either a PartitionedAppendOnlyMap if
 *    we want to combine by key, or a PartitionedPairBuffer if we don't.
 *    Inside these buffers, we sort elements by partition ID and then possibly also by key.
 *    To avoid calling the partitioner multiple times with each key, we store the partition ID
 *    alongside each record.
 *
 *  - When each buffer reaches our memory limit, we spill it to a file. This file is sorted first
 *    by partition ID and possibly second by key or by hash code of the key, if we want to do
 *    aggregation. For each file, we track how many objects were in each partition in memory, so we
 *    don't have to write out the partition ID for every element.
 *
 *  - When the user requests an iterator or file output, the spilled files are merged, along with
 *    any remaining in-memory data, using the same sort order defined above (unless both sorting
 *    and aggregation are disabled). If we need to aggregate by key, we either use a total ordering
 *    from the ordering parameter, or read the keys with the same hash code and compare them with
 *    each other for equality to merge values.
 *
 *  - Users are expected to call stop() at the end to delete all the intermediate files.
