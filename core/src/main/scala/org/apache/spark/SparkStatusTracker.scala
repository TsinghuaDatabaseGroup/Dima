/**
 * Low-level status reporting APIs for monitoring job and stage progress.
 *
 * These APIs intentionally provide very weak consistency semantics; consumers of these APIs should
 * be prepared to handle empty / missing information.  For example, a job's stage ids may be known
 * but the status API may not have any information about the details of those stages, so
 * `getStageInfo` could potentially return `None` for a valid stage id.
 *
 * To limit memory usage, these APIs only provide information on recent jobs / stages.  These APIs
 * will provide information for the last `spark.ui.retainedStages` stages and
 * `spark.ui.retainedJobs` jobs.
 *
 * NOTE: this class's constructor should be considered private and may be subject to change.
