/**
 * Spark class responsible for security.
 *
 * In general this class should be instantiated by the SparkEnv and most components
 * should access it from that. There are some cases where the SparkEnv hasn't been
 * initialized yet and this class must be instantiated directly.
 *
 * Spark currently supports authentication via a shared secret.
 * Authentication can be configured to be on via the 'spark.authenticate' configuration
 * parameter. This parameter controls whether the Spark communication protocols do
 * authentication using the shared secret. This authentication is a basic handshake to
 * make sure both sides have the same shared secret and are allowed to communicate.
 * If the shared secret is not identical they will not be allowed to communicate.
 *
 * The Spark UI can also be secured by using javax servlet filters. A user may want to
 * secure the UI if it has data that other users should not be allowed to see. The javax
 * servlet filter specified by the user can authenticate the user and then once the user
 * is logged in, Spark can compare that user versus the view acls to make sure they are
 * authorized to view the UI. The configs 'spark.acls.enable' and 'spark.ui.view.acls'
 * control the behavior of the acls. Note that the person who started the application
 * always has view access to the UI.
 *
 * Spark has a set of modify acls (`spark.modify.acls`) that controls which users have permission
 * to  modify a single application. This would include things like killing the application. By
 * default the person who started the application has modify access. For modify access through
 * the UI, you must have a filter that does authentication in place for the modify acls to work
 * properly.
 *
 * Spark also has a set of admin acls (`spark.admin.acls`) which is a set of users/administrators
 * who always have permission to view or modify the Spark application.
 *
 * Starting from version 1.3, Spark has partial support for encrypted connections with SSL.
 *
 * At this point spark has multiple communication protocols that need to be secured and
 * different underlying mechanisms are used depending on the protocol:
 *
 *  - Akka -> The only option here is to use the Akka Remote secure-cookie functionality.
 *            Akka remoting allows you to specify a secure cookie that will be exchanged
 *            and ensured to be identical in the connection handshake between the client
 *            and the server. If they are not identical then the client will be refused
 *            to connect to the server. There is no control of the underlying
 *            authentication mechanism so its not clear if the password is passed in
 *            plaintext or uses DIGEST-MD5 or some other mechanism.
 *
 *            Akka also has an option to turn on SSL, this option is currently supported (see
 *            the details below).
 *
 *  - HTTP for broadcast and file server (via HttpServer) ->  Spark currently uses Jetty
 *            for the HttpServer. Jetty supports multiple authentication mechanisms -
 *            Basic, Digest, Form, Spengo, etc. It also supports multiple different login
 *            services - Hash, JAAS, Spnego, JDBC, etc.  Spark currently uses the HashLoginService
 *            to authenticate using DIGEST-MD5 via a single user and the shared secret.
 *            Since we are using DIGEST-MD5, the shared secret is not passed on the wire
 *            in plaintext.
 *
 *            We currently support SSL (https) for this communication protocol (see the details
 *            below).
 *
 *            The Spark HttpServer installs the HashLoginServer and configures it to DIGEST-MD5.
 *            Any clients must specify the user and password. There is a default
 *            Authenticator installed in the SecurityManager to how it does the authentication
 *            and in this case gets the user name and password from the request.
 *
 *  - BlockTransferService -> The Spark BlockTransferServices uses java nio to asynchronously
 *            exchange messages.  For this we use the Java SASL
 *            (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) API and again use DIGEST-MD5
 *            as the authentication mechanism. This means the shared secret is not passed
 *            over the wire in plaintext.
 *            Note that SASL is pluggable as to what mechanism it uses.  We currently use
 *            DIGEST-MD5 but this could be changed to use Kerberos or other in the future.
 *            Spark currently supports "auth" for the quality of protection, which means
 *            the connection does not support integrity or privacy protection (encryption)
 *            after authentication. SASL also supports "auth-int" and "auth-conf" which
 *            SPARK could support in the future to allow the user to specify the quality
 *            of protection they want. If we support those, the messages will also have to
 *            be wrapped and unwrapped via the SaslServer/SaslClient.wrap/unwrap API's.
 *
 *            Since the NioBlockTransferService does asynchronous messages passing, the SASL
 *            authentication is a bit more complex. A ConnectionManager can be both a client
 *            and a Server, so for a particular connection it has to determine what to do.
 *            A ConnectionId was added to be able to track connections and is used to
 *            match up incoming messages with connections waiting for authentication.
 *            The ConnectionManager tracks all the sendingConnections using the ConnectionId,
 *            waits for the response from the server, and does the handshake before sending
 *            the real message.
 *
 *            The NettyBlockTransferService ensures that SASL authentication is performed
 *            synchronously prior to any other communication on a connection. This is done in
 *            SaslClientBootstrap on the client side and SaslRpcHandler on the server side.
 *
 *  - HTTP for the Spark UI -> the UI was changed to use servlets so that javax servlet filters
 *            can be used. Yarn requires a specific AmIpFilter be installed for security to work
 *            properly. For non-Yarn deployments, users can write a filter to go through their
 *            organization's normal login service. If an authentication filter is in place then the
 *            SparkUI can be configured to check the logged in user against the list of users who
 *            have view acls to see if that user is authorized.
 *            The filters can also be used for many different purposes. For instance filters
 *            could be used for logging, encryption, or compression.
 *
 *  The exact mechanisms used to generate/distribute the shared secret are deployment-specific.
 *
 *  For YARN deployments, the secret is automatically generated. The secret is placed in the Hadoop
 *  UGI which gets passed around via the Hadoop RPC mechanism. Hadoop RPC can be configured to
 *  support different levels of protection. See the Hadoop documentation for more details. Each
 *  Spark application on YARN gets a different shared secret.
 *
 *  On YARN, the Spark UI gets configured to use the Hadoop YARN AmIpFilter which requires the user
 *  to go through the ResourceManager Proxy. That proxy is there to reduce the possibility of web
 *  based attacks through YARN. Hadoop can be configured to use filters to do authentication. That
 *  authentication then happens via the ResourceManager Proxy and Spark will use that to do
 *  authorization against the view acls.
 *
 *  For other Spark deployments, the shared secret must be specified via the
 *  spark.authenticate.secret config.
 *  All the nodes (Master and Workers) and the applications need to have the same shared secret.
 *  This again is not ideal as one user could potentially affect another users application.
 *  This should be enhanced in the future to provide better protection.
 *  If the UI needs to be secure, the user needs to install a javax servlet filter to do the
 *  authentication. Spark will then use that user to compare against the view acls to do
 *  authorization. If not filter is in place the user is generally null and no authorization
 *  can take place.
 *
 *  When authentication is being used, encryption can also be enabled by setting the option
 *  spark.authenticate.enableSaslEncryption to true. This is only supported by communication
 *  channels that use the network-common library, and can be used as an alternative to SSL in those
 *  cases.
 *
 *  SSL can be used for encryption for certain communication channels. The user can configure the
 *  default SSL settings which will be used for all the supported communication protocols unless
 *  they are overwritten by protocol specific settings. This way the user can easily provide the
 *  common settings for all the protocols without disabling the ability to configure each one
 *  individually.
 *
 *  All the SSL settings like `spark.ssl.xxx` where `xxx` is a particular configuration property,
 *  denote the global configuration for all the supported protocols. In order to override the global
 *  configuration for the particular protocol, the properties must be overwritten in the
 *  protocol-specific namespace. Use `spark.ssl.yyy.xxx` settings to overwrite the global
 *  configuration for particular protocol denoted by `yyy`. Currently `yyy` can be either `akka` for
 *  Akka based connections or `fs` for broadcast and file server.
 *
 *  Refer to [[org.apache.spark.SSLOptions]] documentation for the list of
 *  options that can be specified.
 *
 *  SecurityManager initializes SSLOptions objects for different protocols separately. SSLOptions
 *  object parses Spark configuration at a given namespace and builds the common representation
 *  of SSL settings. SSLOptions is then used to provide protocol-specific configuration like
 *  TypeSafe configuration for Akka or SSLContextFactory for Jetty.
 *
 *  SSL must be configured on each node and configured for each component involved in
 *  communication using the particular protocol. In YARN clusters, the key-store can be prepared on
 *  the client side then distributed and used by the executors as the part of the application
 *  (YARN allows the user to deploy files before the application is started).
 *  In standalone deployment, the user needs to provide key-stores and configuration
 *  options for master and workers. In this mode, the user may allow the executors to use the SSL
 *  settings inherited from the worker which spawned that executor. It can be accomplished by
 *  setting `spark.ssl.useNodeLocalConf` to `true`.
