/**
 * This class represents an input stream that monitors a Hadoop-compatible filesystem for new
 * files and creates a stream out of them. The way it works as follows.
 *
 * At each batch interval, the file system is queried for files in the given directory and
 * detected new files are selected for that batch. In this case "new" means files that
 * became visible to readers during that time period. Some extra care is needed to deal
 * with the fact that files may become visible after they are created. For this purpose, this
 * class remembers the information about the files selected in past batches for
 * a certain duration (say, "remember window") as shown in the figure below.
 *
 * {{{
 *                      |<----- remember window ----->|
 * ignore threshold --->|                             |<--- current batch time
 *                      |____.____.____.____.____.____|
 *                      |    |    |    |    |    |    |
 * ---------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----------------------> Time
 *                      |____|____|____|____|____|____|
 *                             remembered batches
 * }}}
 *
 * The trailing end of the window is the "ignore threshold" and all files whose mod times
 * are less than this threshold are assumed to have already been selected and are therefore
 * ignored. Files whose mod times are within the "remember window" are checked against files
 * that have already been selected. At a high level, this is how new files are identified in
 * each batch - files whose mod times are greater than the ignore threshold and
 * have not been considered within the remember window. See the documentation on the method
 * `isNewFile` for more details.
 *
 * This makes some assumptions from the underlying file system that the system is monitoring.
 *
 *  - The clock of the file system is assumed to synchronized with the clock of the machine running
 *    the streaming app.
 *  - If a file is to be visible in the directory listings, it must be visible within a certain
 *    duration of the mod time of the file. This duration is the "remember window", which is set to
 *    1 minute (see `FileInputDStream.minRememberDuration`). Otherwise, the file will never be
 *    selected as the mod time will be less than the ignore threshold when it becomes visible.
 *  - Once a file is visible, the mod time cannot change. If it does due to appends, then the
 *    processing semantics are undefined.
