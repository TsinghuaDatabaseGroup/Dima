/**
 * Counts words in text encoded with UTF8 received from the network every second.

 * Usage: RecoverableNetworkWordCount <hostname> <port> <checkpoint-directory> <output-file>
 *   <hostname> and <port> describe the TCP server that Spark Streaming would connect to receive
 *   data. <checkpoint-directory> directory to HDFS-compatible file system which checkpoint data
 *   <output-file> file to which the word counts will be appended
 *
 * <checkpoint-directory> and <output-file> must be absolute paths
 *
 * To run this on your local machine, you need to first run a Netcat server
 *
 *      `$ nc -lk 9999`
 *
 * and run the example as
 *
 *      `$ ./bin/run-example org.apache.spark.examples.streaming.RecoverableNetworkWordCount \
 *              localhost 9999 ~/checkpoint/ ~/out`
 *
 * If the directory ~/checkpoint/ does not exist (e.g. running for the first time), it will create
 * a new StreamingContext (will print "Creating new context" to the console). Otherwise, if
 * checkpoint data exists in ~/checkpoint/, then it will create StreamingContext from
 * the checkpoint data.
 *
 * Refer to the online documentation for more details.
